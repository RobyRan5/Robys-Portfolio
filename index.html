    <p> What a great day to be Roby, well really anyone in these exciting amazing times we all live in. Through my
        experiences during these past 15 years of business development, account management and sales, I have come to
        respect the character and being of people and their businesses. I noticed a missing link between taking ideas
        from thoughts to creation, to implementation and market. The missing link was full stack engineering.

        Now with proven success in full stack development, the opportunity is available for all dynamics to be
        preformed. With a emphasis on efficiency and productivity, I have created success of measurable performance and
        creative engineering. One of the performance areas with heavy emphasis is the scope of development. Identifying
        the opportunities with the internal structure as well external and implementing processes with identifiable
        performance.
